"Recipelinks HomeCookingAdventure.py"
The first sample "Recipelinks HomeCookingAdventure.py", is a utility to scrape and provide descriptions and 'redirection' links of recipes from a provided URL provided by one of my favourite cooking sites, www.homecooking.adventure.
I wrote it to simplify the extracting and selection of recipe links for loading into my favourite Recipe App, Paprika. To reduce my keystrokes.
