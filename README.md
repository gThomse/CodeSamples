# CodeSamples

"Recipelinks HomeCookingAdventure.py"
The first sample "Recipelinks HomeCookingAdventure.py", is a utility to scrape and provide descriptions and 'redirection' links of recipes from a provided URL provided by one of my favourite cooking sites, www.homecooking.adventure.
I wrote it to simplify the extracting and selection of recipe links for loading into my favourite Recipe App, Paprika. To reduce my keystrokes.

"International Appointments.py"
Is a utility I wrote to list times around the world of destinations I have friends and family.

"flight time2.py" and Flights.xlsx
Is a utility I wrote to convert airline arrival and departure times on my travel schedule to local dates and times for relatives in Australia wanting to track the trip.

"HEIC_to_JPG.py"
Is a utility I wrote to convert HEIC pictures to JPG format.
